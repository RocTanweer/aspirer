# Aspirer
A small Web Application which is made to help you manage your *running* and *cycling* activities. This is just another version of [mapty](https://mapty.netlify.app/), 
a project made originally by [jonas](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman). I though why not making this all by myself from scratch and not just the JavaScript part that
Jonas showed in his [udemyCoarse](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). So here is my version with some extra features.
